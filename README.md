Welcome to Petafly!

This is a File Transfer program, where instead of uploading your files to a cloud server, and then other users download your files from that server. You are the server!
That means that you and the other user must have both devices online to download!
The good part is that there's no file limit, you can upload anything you want! And your internet speed won't be limited by another service!

Release Notes:

- PublicExperimentalTest 1: Base Program, There's no English Support for now, poor interface, Ngrok not configured so only file transfers through the same Wi-Fi from any to any device.
