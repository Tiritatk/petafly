  <h3>Transfer files up to a Petabyte! (If you have a file with that size, of course ;)</h3>
  
<div align="justify">
This is a File Transfer program, where instead of uploading your files to a cloud server, and then other users download your files from that server. You are the server!
That means that you and the other user must have both devices online to download!
The good part is that there's no file limit, you can upload anything you want! And your internet speed won't be limited by another service!

Release Notes:
</h3>

<p>
<b>- PublicExperimentalTest 1:</b> Base Program, There's no English Support for now, poor interface, Ngrok not configured so only file transfers through the same Wi-Fi from any to any device.<p>
<b>- PublicExperimentalTest 2:</b> Bugfix Version: Fixed a lot of bugs related with interface, colors, and make everything easier for the final user, Ngrok will be added when everything else is finished.<p> 
<b>- PublicExperimentalTest 3:</b> I fixed almost every color or interface bug that made hard for the user to understand what's happening because of so much text accumulating on screen. Fixed a bug when opening more than one port, because default port is 80, and the console opened 80 all the time causing a glitch. Now when you open 2 or more HTTP Servers, the first port will be 80, then 8000, and after this just +1 every time (8000, 8001, 8002, 8003, 8004...) Fixed several exceptions that made the program crash in certain situations without giving an error, confusing the user, and I'm starting to prepare a stable version for testing purposes that doesn't update every time i make a change.
