Thanks for downloading Petafly!

First, before running the .exe, run the "InstallDependencies.bat" file to install and check everything is in order.
You need to make sure that you have Python3.x installed, to be able to open HTTP Servers, I mean, that's the point of the whole program!
(Also you need a ngrok account, you will be prompted with a Terminal asking you for the key that you receive after login in ngrok webiste)


Release Notes:

- PublicExperimentalTest 1: Base Program, There's no English Support for now, poor interface, Ngrok not configured so only file transfers through the same Wi-Fi from any to any device.
